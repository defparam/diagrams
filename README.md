# Diagrams
Diagrams of common HW/SW structures to help out all!

Hey everyone! I'll be quick. I enjoy designing architecture in Visio. Sometimes when I come across something confusing I'll draw it out in Visio and reference as needed during architecture and design. This repo is a collection of diagrams I feel are useful to all engineers and researchers. For every diagram along with the PNG file I'll try to keep a corresponding Visio vsdx file. 

I hope you enjoy!
